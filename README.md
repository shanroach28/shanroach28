- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shannon Roach
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in UX/UI design, building mechanical keyboards, software development, backpacking, and more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web design on my own, practicing CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as working on Python skills.
(many of the other projects and assignments i have worked on over the years have been for unvi course work and professors have expressed to not share online)
